<h4>Pollution prevention </h4>

<p> Pollution prevention measures reduce exposure to hazardous substances and pollutants, thereby protecting human health from respiratory diseases, waterborne illnesses, and other adverse health effects associated with pollution.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Different types of pollution (air, water, soil) and their sources.
        <ul>
            <li>Air pollution:
                Industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust, agricultural activities, combustion of fossil fuels, wildfires, and indoor sources such as cooking and heating with solid fuels.</li>
            <li>Soil pollution:
                Industrial activities (landfills, mining, manufacturing), agricultural practices (use of pesticides, fertilizers), improper waste disposal, and contamination from hazardous substances (heavy metals, pesticides, petroleum products).</li>
        </ul>
    
    </li>
    <li>
        Strategies to prevent pollution and mitigate its impact on the environment and human health
        <ul>
            <li>Constructing wastewater treatment plants and sewage systems to treat and disinfect contaminated water before discharge into water bodies.</li>
            <li>Promoting behavior change and responsible consumer choices to reduce waste generation, conserve resources, and minimize pollution.</li>
        </ul>
