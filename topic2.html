<h4>Sustainable resource management</h4>

<p> Sustainable resource management aims to conserve natural resources, such as forests, freshwater, and minerals, and ensures their responsible use to meet current and future needs without depleting or degrading them.

<ol>
    <li>
        Principles of sustainable resource management and utilization.
        <ul>
            <li>Sustainable resource management seeks to balance environmental, economic, and social considerations to promote resilience, equity, and sustainability.</li>
            <li>Key principles include minimizing waste and pollution, promoting renewable and low-impact alternatives, conserving biodiversity and ecosystem services, and fostering community participation and empowerment.</li>
        </ul>

    <li>
        Explanation of renewable and non-renewable resources and their sustainable use.
        <ul>
            <li>Renewable resources are replenished naturally over time and include sunlight, wind, water, biomass, and geothermal energy. They are considered sustainable when harvested at rates that do not exceed natural regeneration rates.</li>
            <li>Non-renewable resources are finite and include fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas), minerals, and metals. They are extracted from the Earth's crust and cannot be replenished on human timescales.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

</ol>
